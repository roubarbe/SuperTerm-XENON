SuperTerm XENON
===============

Customizable web-based terminal interface

Live demo: http://rawgit.com/roubarbe/SuperTerm-XENON/master/stxenon.html

##WHAT IS THIS?
St-ZÃ©non is a cute little village in Quebec, thus a 
play-on-words on a funny-named place.

This is a (nearly) fully-featured web-based terminal ready
to be bent and mended to your needs. All you need is to define
the actual commands and what they do.

Basically, this provides you with a functional interface.


##WHAT DO I NEED?
This app/library/whatever requires jQuery and has, for now, worked
fine with the latest stable release.

jQuery v1.11.0 (minimized) is included.

Some neat little effects may require a CSS3-compliant browser.


##HOW TO USE:
Simply join it to your HTML file. Ready to serve. Kind-of.
You'll have to make your own commands.

See [How to make my own commands](https://github.com/roubarbe/SuperTerm-XENON/wiki/How-to-make-my-own-commands%3F) for a detailed guide on how to make a working command.

##Whoa, what are these error messages I'm getting?
Error codes are kind-of documented in the source-code, but I recommend reading [Error Codes](https://github.com/roubarbe/SuperTerm-XENON/wiki/Error-Codes).


##LICENSE?
You are free to use it, modify it, tattoo your name on it
or whatever tickles you fancy but please mention me somewhere!

(This means Apache, guys. Thanks.)
